Kubernetes Architecture:

Control Plane(Master node)
1)API server : exposed the cluster to external world, Take the requester from external and decides where the pods need to go
2)Etcd : details about the cluster information
3)Scheduler: Schedule the pod in healthy worker node after API server decides where to schedule it
4)Controller: Ensure always the current state is same the desired state
5)CCM : Cloud control manager integrates with the cloud technologies running in a cloud environment.


Data Plane(Worker node)
1)Container runtime : Any container runtime, to run containers in worker node.
2)Kubeproxy : network component that provides network, ensure each pod get ipaddress and loadbalancing across all pod in a service
3)Kubectl : agents that run on each worker node, responsible for managing the resources, watches the API server for tasks, get the instruction from master and report back to master
